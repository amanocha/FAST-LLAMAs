# Graph Projections in python:

Here we provide the Numba compilable Python version of the graph projection code that has the capability to use DEC++ in its compilation pathway.

Here is how to run it on command line:

> python3.6m graph_projections.py input_file_path 'projection_type'

where the projection_type can be "count", "flag", "weighted" for the three different types of projections.
